<p>Famously the 2007 grassroots motor sports challenge had the “cheapparal” C4 vette gem. The team there used a secondary engine attached to a 2 stage axial blower and a box attached to the bottom of the car.</p>
<p>Let’s look at what they did and some of the numbers involved.<br>￼<br>Although looking at these numbers, not only is the design of the actual skirt smaller than the calculated, but it appears that the engine is able to generate 2x the inches of water (10 inches of water according to video) which roughly translates to 2.4kpa or 0.34psi vacuum with the smaller skirt. Obviously I don’t have the formulas for how they came up with these numbers.</p>
<p>The C4 vette wheelbase is approx 96 inches long by 71 inches wide. It looks to be just a few inches less wide than the car so let’s call it the 48 inches wide they gave and 75 inches long (based on visual insight) giving an area of approx 3,600 square inches. I think where they made their length mistake, is they assumed they would be able to do something the length of the whole car instead of just between the wheels. Leakage area would also be a bit less given this.</p>
<p>I do not see anywhere where they are actually measuring downforce but it certainly looks impressive in the video when it goes through the autocross course. If their calculations are right, it seems like they are probably generating well over 1000lbs.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Screen%20Shot%202021-02-03%20at%2010.50.13%20PM.png" alt="cheapparal screenshot"></p>
<p>Looking on to other famous cars, the McLaren F1, it recently came to light with Professor Murray’s new car, the T.50’s intro, that the F1 itself was a fan car, using 2 140mm fans:</p>
<p>“It had two 140mm fans, sucking the air out of them and when you switched them on we got five percent downforce and a two percent reduction in drag.” according to Murray. It’s worth noting that’s without a “sucker attachment” grabbing the F1 to the ground the way that the Cheapparal did.</p>
<p>Of course, the new T.50 itself boasts an 8.5kw, 48v fan. We’ll see how that performs when reviews start coming out next year. I’m sure it will be astounding regardless of what the fan is capable of.</p>
<p>So comparing two roadgoing fan cars that we have numbers on that we can compare, the Cheapparal and the F1 - one with a massive fan that sucked an old Vette to the ground, one with some tiny fans that aided the aero of a hypercar with 5% extra downforce.</p>
<p>It really gets one thinking… What is the minimum amount of fan required to actively add downforce to a vehicle for road/autocross/whatever use? What other aides need to be considered? Is it possible to mitigate the dust storm effect of the Cheapparral on a reasonably useful setup?</p>
<p>Personally I wonder about splitting the difference between the Cheapparral and McLaren (lol) and using a couple of 16” 3000CFM 12v fans: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3rjzCSP">https://amzn.to/3rjzCSP</a> - one could even squeeze some more flow out of these ramping up the voltage by attaching one of these to each fan: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3cLfdCh">https://amzn.to/3cLfdCh</a></p>
<p>Let me outline what I am thinking on a C4 vette. Mostly because I have a C4 vette kart that I’d consider doing it to.</p>
<p><img src="/images/c4diagram.png" alt="c4 bottom with drawn pieces"><br>That might be a little hard to follow unless you’re in my head.</p>
<p>Here’s a more simple drawing without the car:<br><img src="/images/diagramdrawn.png" alt="just drawing"></p>
<p>I’m suggesting 2 boxes to help create a good seal to the ground. If one box gets bent out of shape (temporarily or permanently,) pressure and suction can be maintained. The boxes could be built from simple landscape edging (like what you see on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/36HNOwY">https://amzn.to/36HNOwY</a>) - every racer’s favorite - and could be simply replaced as it wears out. I believe building a bracket system on the bottom of the car out of aluminum angle stock (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2NY5nlW">https://amzn.to/2NY5nlW</a>) would provide a great support to mount the landscape edging to and is easy to work with. I would mount the edging material so it is barely touching the ground with the suspension at rest and let it self clearance from there.</p>
<p>Additionally, sealing in an exhaust like this doesn’t seem great. If I were to do this I would likely want to switch to sidepipes to make it really easy to box in the bottom of the car (the driveshaft is well out of the way)</p>
<p>Even hopped up to 18v, a 3000CFM fan isn’t going to</p>
<p>Thoughts? Better off just doing a big wing? I’ll post back if I decide to pursue this at all.</p>

This is huge in the Datsun community where people commonly pay $1,000+ for NOS or remanufactured dashboards, or go with a simple dash cap for nearly $200 (see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3omPX7Z">here</a> for an example.) None of these options are very good.</p>
<p>I’m here to tell you that there are other options out there, for less money than even slapping a cap on the dashboard, and it will look better too. Flocking your dashboard will result in a suede-like finish from modern rally cars, and is also relatively easy to repair in the future. All you need is several hours of time, a little patience and hard work, and a few parts:</p>
<h3 id="Parts-list"><a href="#Parts-list" class="headerlink" title="Parts list"></a>Parts list</h3><p>I’ve listed out everything that I used on this project on amazon. You’ll notice that you should have around $100 into this by the time you’re done. I noted which items you may need more of if your dash is severely damaged and which items are reusable:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/31ck8pz">black flocking</a> - 1 bag should be enough</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/31ck8pz">3m super77 spray adhesive</a> - 1 new bottle ought to be enough</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2VgEn1s">bondo with hardener</a> - you may need more than one of these depending on how badly damaged your dash is</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2JfQbyO">2x high build primer</a> - again, you may need more depending on how bad the damage is</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3ms5SRQ">2x black spray paint</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/33xJVcm">220 grit sandpaper roll</a> - you won’t use all of this</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2VxatGB">400 grit sandpaper roll</a> - you won’t use all of this</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/37jVWDv">water spray bottle</a> - reusable!</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3qclYB7">sanding block kit</a> - reusable!</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3mkebPo">razor knife</a> - reusable!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Planning"><a href="#Planning" class="headerlink" title="Planning"></a>Planning</h2><p>We’re going to follow roughly these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>removal</li>
<li>cutting away bad material</li>
<li>cleaning</li>
<li>bondoing + sanding</li>
<li>painting + sanding</li>
<li>flocking</li>
<li>reinstall</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="How-to"><a href="#How-to" class="headerlink" title="How to"></a>How to</h2><h3 id="Step-1-removal"><a href="#Step-1-removal" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 - removal"></a>Step 1 - removal</h3><p>Remove the dashboard. This can be a big job depending on your car. I recommend being as careful as possible here. Bag up and label screws, make sure you know which connectors go where, try not to break things. You don’t want to be ordering up new trim because you decided to muscle the dashboard out of the car.</p>
<p>You should now have a dash sitting on the ground that looks like this:<br><img src="/images/IMG_6253.jpg.c00d1f28a6935d227ed6b83a31c5ab36.jpg" alt="damaged dashboard"><br>(note: This picture wasn’t the dash that appears in the rest of the pics. This is one that I found on google images. The dashboard in the rest of the pictures had similar damage in the same spots.)</p>
<h3 id="Step-2-cutting"><a href="#Step-2-cutting" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 - cutting"></a>Step 2 - cutting</h3><p>When dashboards crack, they curl. Cut the dashboard all the way back to where it’s no longer curling using a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3mkebPo">razor knife</a>. Your cracks might be twice the size they were prior to this step - that’s okay! There’s no turning back now.</p>
<h3 id="Step-3-cleaning"><a href="#Step-3-cleaning" class="headerlink" title="Step 3 - cleaning"></a>Step 3 - cleaning</h3><p>Clean your dashboard really well with soapy water and clean it well between layers of work as you continue through the steps. I just use dish soap. Dust and dirt are going to be your enemy - they could cause imperfections or cause bad adhesion between any of the bondo, paint, or spray adhesive products that we’re going to use.</p>
<h3 id="Step-4-bondo-high-build-primer-sanding"><a href="#Step-4-bondo-high-build-primer-sanding" class="headerlink" title="Step 4 - bondo + high build primer + sanding"></a>Step 4 - bondo + high build primer + sanding</h3><p><img src="/images/1%20-%204IsjNm4.jpg" alt="bondo complete pic 1"><br>This is the most time consuming step. Tons of and tons of bondo and lots and lots of sanding. We are taking an old dashboard skeleton and re-shaping it out of bondo. You might end up with a full day into this.</p>
<p>Before I begin, I spray <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2JfQbyO">high build primer</a> over the whole dashboard. This helps me spot low or high spots and also helps me from damaging healthy plastic parts of the dash that I do not want to sand on. Any time we blast through the primer, it’s time to lay down a bit more primer.</p>
<p>Bondo over each of your cracks with a bondo blade, smooth it out as much as you can, sand it, and then repeat. Your bondo here must go well beyond the cracked areas of the dashboard and the entire top of the dashboard needs to be covered in at least a thin (say 1/4 inch layer) of bondo. You’re making the dash slightly taller here but it’s important that we do this. If we just bondo and smooth up to where we cut on the last step, the dashboard will just crack there within a year or two and we will be yanking the dashboard agian to repeat this same job.</p>
<p>As I work, I continue to spray coats of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2JfQbyO">high build primer</a> over sanded parts of the dashboard, to help spot high and low spots as I sand and to help protect good parts of the dashboard.</p>
<p>When sanding, I do the first several layers with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/33xJVcm">220 grit sandpaper</a> and then use the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2VxatGB">400 grit sandpaper</a> before moving on to the next step. I use my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3qclYB7">sanding block kit</a> to help get into all of the small spots and over the large humps and curves in the dashboard. If you try doing this by hand you may end up with some odd waves in your work – the same as doing bodywork on the outside of a car!</p>
<p>When you’re done bonding and sanding, shoot one last coat of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2JfQbyO">high build primer</a> then sand it gently and evenly with 400 grit. There should be no visible scratches, low points, etc, before moving on. You should be looking at a perfect smooth, gray dashboard when you are finished here. No bondo should be exposed</p>
<p><img src="/images/2%20-%20zjoCURE.jpg" alt="bondo complete pic 2"></p>
<p><img src="/images/3%20-%20q7HpZrH.jpg" alt="bondo complete pic 3"><br>Here you can see the many layers over the gauge clusters to get them close to right - it’s a lot!</p>
<p><img src="/images/4%20-%20Szh65Nh.jpg" alt="bondo complete pic 4"></p>
<h3 id="Step-5-painting"><a href="#Step-5-painting" class="headerlink" title="Step 5 - painting"></a>Step 5 - painting</h3><p><img src="/images/5%20-%20tbAW3wT.jpg" alt="1st coat of paint pic 1"><br>Now that we’re done with the hard work, it’s time for things to start looking better. Coat the entire dashboard in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3ms5SRQ">black spray paint</a>. Our goal here is to get a uniform, smooth, black dashboard, for us to adhere flocking material to.</p>
<p><img src="/images/6%20-%20MWpqru4.jpg" alt="1st coat of paint pic 2"></p>
<h3 id="Step-6-a-little-more-sanding"><a href="#Step-6-a-little-more-sanding" class="headerlink" title="Step 6 - a little more sanding"></a>Step 6 - a little more sanding</h3><p><img src="/images/7%20-%20d0OM4co.jpg" alt="1st coat of paint sanded pic 1"><br>After drying sand the 1st coat of paint to remove any imperfections. I will generally wet sand during this step, with a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/37jVWDv">water spray bottle</a> and the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2VxatGB">400 grit sandpaper</a></p>
<p><img src="/images/8%20-%20HTJpiu1.jpg" alt="1st coat of paint sanded pic 2"><br>Here you can see some spots where we completely sanded the paint away due to imperfections</p>
<h3 id="Step-7-more-painting"><a href="#Step-7-more-painting" class="headerlink" title="Step 7 - more painting"></a>Step 7 - more painting</h3><p><img src="/images/9%20-%20LQhmmH2.jpg" alt="2nd coat of paint pic 1"><br>Add one more thick coat of paint, ensuring that you don’t get any runs. Let this paint dray and do not sand it. You should have a great looking, smooth, black dashboard now. It should look pretty good! If not, back up and get to sanding. The end is in sight.</p>
<p><img src="/images/10%20-%205ZHp5eo.jpg" alt="2nd coat of paint pic 2"></p>
<h3 id="Step-8-flocking"><a href="#Step-8-flocking" class="headerlink" title="Step 8 - flocking"></a>Step 8 - flocking</h3><p><img src="/images/11%20-%20CAosZ5c.jpg" alt="flocked pic 1"><br>People do flocking in different ways. I recommend re-reading this section a few times before trying my way as it as this is somewhat unique from what I have seen. This is a method that I have found works really well for me which does not involve using a normal flocking adhesive that must be painted on, or a flocking gun.</p>
<p>I prefer to use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/31ck8pz">3m super77 spray adhesive</a> and find that it works very, very well for holding flocking. You do need to work sort of fast here as the spray adhesive does not have a long cure time. You might test out your methods on a sheet of cardboard first to get the hang of it.</p>
<p>To start, absolutely hose the dash down with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/31ck8pz">3m super77 spray adhesive</a> without getting any runs - every single nook and cranny should have a uniform amount of spray adhesive. I like to imagine I am spray painting on the adhesive, that’s what it should look like when you’re done.</p>
<p>Once the adhesive is on, - again, working quickly - cover the dashboard in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/31ck8pz">black flocking</a>. I pick up handfulls out of the bag and dump it on or throw it in to some of the tighter areas. It does not need to be uniform - everything just needs covered so the spray adhesive makes contact with the flocking. If you have a flocking gun, you can use it at this step, but it is not required (I own one but did not use it here.)</p>
<p>After everything is covered in flocking, begin patting the flocking on with your hands. Apply a decent amount of pressure to the flocking but don’t smear it. Go over the entire dashboard a few times, patting. Make sure you pat every single spot that you can reach your fingers. We are patting the flocking on after applying to ensure that it really sticks into the spray adhesive. This gives the adhesive a chance to saturate the flocking and really grab it.</p>
<p>Let the dashboard sit overnight in a warm place with the patted flocking sitting on it. Don’t touch it! Don’t think about touching it! We want the adhesive to cure. 3m says this takes 24 hours.</p>
<p>After the dashboard as sat for a while, gently dust off the flocking. I collect the used flocking in a bag and re-use it as bits of dirt or debris don’t tend to cause any problems with using flocking.</p>
<p>You are done. Now we get to put things back together.</p>
<p>Note! If you are not interested in the flocking, one can skip this and instead shoot the dash in a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3o7jPF2">textured paint</a>. With this, you can get a similar to factory appearance.</p>

<p>After having honed this method on a few dashboard after trying and failing to achieve a nice look with other methods (some listed in the links below) I have found that this is a great way to achieve a nice dashboard for a very reasonable price.</p>
<p>Any questions, comments, project pics of your own to share? Contact me, I’d love to hear about how your project is going</p>
<h4 id="related-links-for-further-reading"><a href="#related-links-for-further-reading" class="headerlink" title="related links for further reading"></a>related links for further reading</h4><p>Obviously I didn’t come up with most of the ideas here on my own. I leaned on others’ similar projects and simply added my own twist. Here are some links to ones that I found helpful:</p>

		<p>This is my very first blog post. I’ve been meaning to set up a blog for a while to post about interesting projects that I’m working on.</p>
<p>Things that I’ll be posting about on this blog include:</p>
<ul>
<li>small programming projects and thoughts<ul>
<li>especially javascript-based (nodejs or in the browser)</li>
<li>video game programming</li>
<li>engineering management?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>app or program ideas and half-baked implementations of them</li>
<li>automotive modifications, restoration posts, aftermarket parts installs, guides, etc</li>
<li>dumb automotive ideas</li>
<li>children’s toy fixes (especially ones with small parts that are easy to break)</li>
<li>3d printing stuff and other “maker” type projects<ul>
<li>lots of small projects involving raspberry pis</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>power wheels repair and modification, parts installs, upgrades, etc</li>
<li>general DIYer stuff</li>
</ul>
<p>I may do some youtube videos if things need further explanation than what I’m able to blog about here.</p>
<p>I’ll be looking to backfill some posts as I get to them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Destroyed Datsun 240Z dashboard brought back to life</li>
<li>Power wheels motor swaps + battery upgrades</li>
<li>VTech Toy tool box replacement parts + PDF example</li>
<li>C4 Corvette Microsquirt install</li>
<li>C4 Corvette XSPower SBC single turbo kit install and thoughts</li>
<li>Datsun 240Z/L28ET MS2 install</li>
<li>$5 miata “solid” diff+trans brace install</li>
<li>eBay miata turbo kit+DIYPNP parts list and install write up</li>
</ul>
<p>Planning to do some more cool posts on these topics in the future as I get to the projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Power wheels remote steering + remote accelerator/stop button install</li>
<li>More interesting Corvette and Datsun projects</li>
</ul>
<p>And whatever else I get to!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading</p>
