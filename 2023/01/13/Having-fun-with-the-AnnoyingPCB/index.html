			<p>I had recently heard about a new product called the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3Wb0FP2">AnnoyingPCB</a>. It’s essentially a small circuit board that can be programmed to emit one of several different noises, including a loud chirping noise, at random intervals between 5 and 45 minutes. I thought it would be the perfect tool to prank my spouse and kids, who had recently started sleeping through the night like clockwork.</p>
<p>As a young parent of several children, I had become accustomed to waking up 2 to 3 times a night to help put them back to sleep, comfort them from a bad dream, get them water, etc. But now that they were all sound sleepers, I found myself waking up alone and lonely in the middle of the night. I needed something to keep me entertained during those lonely hours.</p>
<p>So, I decided to put the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3Wb0FP2">AnnoyingPCB</a> to use. I carefully placed it in mine and my spouse’s bedroom. I eagerly waited for her reaction.</p>
<p>Sure enough, later that night, the chirping noise went off, and my spouse jolted awake. She looked around confused, trying to figure out where the noise was coming from. I stifled a laugh as I watched her fumble around in the dark, searching for the source of the noise.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, she finally gave up and went back to sleep. After only another 15 minutes, the chirping noise rewarded me again. This time, she was not amused.</p>
<p>“What the hell is that noise?” She grumbled as she rolled over and pulled the covers over her head.</p>
<p>I couldn’t contain my laughter as I imagined her lying there, wide awake and frustrated. Finally others were awake with me.</p>
<p>It was a hilarious game at first, but after a few weeks, it started to take a toll on our sleep. I could see it was starting to affect my wife’s mood, and I didn’t want to be the cause of that. So, I decided to remove the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3Wb0FP2">AnnoyingPCB</a> from our room.</p>
<p>You would think that would be the end of the story, but I couldn’t resist using it on my children.</p>
<p>I sneakily hid one of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3Wb0FP2">AnnoyingPCB</a> in each of my children’s rooms. Luckily I still had our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3CLVsqe">Arlo Baby Cameras</a> installed in their rooms so I could watch later on my phone. It was hilarious to see them jump awake in the middle of the night, groggily trying to figure out where the noise was coming from.</p>
<p>It was a hilarious game, and it gave me something to look forward to each night. My family members may not have found it as amusing as I did, but I couldn’t help but feel a sense of satisfaction knowing that I had successfully managed to annoy them.</p>
<p>But after a month or so, I decided to stop the prank, as I could see it was starting to affect my family’s sleep. Instead, I found other ways to keep myself entertained during the night, like writing this blog.</p>
